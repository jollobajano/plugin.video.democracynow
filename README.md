Democracy Now! is a national, daily, independent, award-winning news
program hosted by journalists Amy Goodman and Juan
Gonzalez. Pioneering the largest public media collaboration in the
U.S., Democracy Now! is broadcast on Pacifica, NPR, community, and
college radio stations; on public access, PBS, satellite television
(DISH network: Free Speech TV ch. 9415 and Link TV ch. 9410; DIRECTV:
Free Speech TV ch. 348 and Link TV ch. 375); and on the
internet. DN!’s podcast is one of the most popular on the web. 

Democracy Now!’s War and Peace Report provides our audience with
access to people and perspectives rarely heard in the
U.S.corporate-sponsored media, including independent and international
journalists, ordinary people from around the world who are directly
affected by U.S. foreign policy, grassroots leaders and peace
activists, artists, academics and independent analysts. In addition,
Democracy Now! hosts real debates–debates between people who
substantially disagree, such as between the White House or the
Pentagon spokespeople on the one hand, and grassroots activists on the
other.
